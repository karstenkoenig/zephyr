* no way to define catch all filter that will take both extended and standard ids
* filter checking is expensive
* filter interface seems geared towards stm32_can
* error handling weird, when do they get reported? if message still sent successfully?
* loopback vs silent loopback? mcp2515 silent loopback is just loopback, needs clear documentation
* segments weird, mcp2515 allows more options
* dts integration
* k_sem_reset(&mb->tx_int_sem); in stm32_can can cause missed interrupt
* rx order can be screwed up on isr refetch
